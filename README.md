Modified letrozole versus GnRH antagonist protocols in ovarian aging women for IVF: a multi-center RCT

Background: In women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) or advanced maternal age scheduled for IVF, 
the use of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) remains challenging.Methods: From 2020-2023, 
318 DOR women (antral follicle count <5 or anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone 0.1-1.1 ng/mL) or 
advanced-age patients (40-45 years) were randomized to modified letrozole protocol (mLP) (n=159) or GnRH antagonist (GnRH-ant) (n=159). 
Primary outcomes (cumulative live birth rate [CLBR], cumulative clinical pregnancy rate [CCPR]) were analyzed by Full Analyssi Set (FAS) and per-protocol approaches
